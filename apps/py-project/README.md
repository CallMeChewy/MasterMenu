# Bootstrap Python Project

Creates a simple Python project structure with `src`, `tests`, and `docs` folders plus starter files. Choose a project name and parent directory when launching; the tool will populate the folder using sensible defaults without setting up a virtualenv.

## Generated Files

- `README.md` and `requirements.txt`
- `src/__init__.py` and `tests/__init__.py`
- `.gitignore` tuned for Python projects

## Usage

1. Launch and enter a project name.
2. Pick the parent folder that should contain the new project.
3. Confirm any overwrite prompt if the folder already exists.
4. A terminal window shows the created tree (if `tree` is installed) so you can inspect the result immediately.
