# GitHub CLI Login

Opens a terminal and runs `gh auth login` so you can refresh credentials without hunting for a shell session.

## Usage

1. Launch the tool; a terminal window will prompt for the authentication method (web, device, or token).
2. Follow the instructions provided by the GitHub CLI.
3. Close the terminal after the login succeeds to return to the menu.

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed.
- Network access to GitHub during the login flow.
