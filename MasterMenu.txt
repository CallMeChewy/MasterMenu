i have a lot of utilities i run to support development. isome are simple shell scripts, some are more complicated python programs. i would like to consolidate them into a common menu system where i can place items under categories. this folder contains examples of these scripts/programs. i expect some/many will have to be changes to accomodate a connon MasterMenu approach. i would like a pyside gui app to present this menu.  i would like a maintenance mode where i can design the laayout. specify categories, add new items, drag and drop / rerrange layout. your basic resturant menu that will launch the item indepemdantly and then be closeable. these are just examples of items i would like on the menu. we can work work out how these items have to be structured. they will all live in folders in the samp project MasterMenu folder. lets discuss a plan.
